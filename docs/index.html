                <div class="body-text sub-font"> 
                    <p>The island of Vieques, a municipality of Puerto Rico, remains steadfast in its ongoing battle against displacement. With its 172 pristine beaches, it holds the potential to be a tranquil vacation haven for visitors, while serving as the permanent residence for around 8,000 individuals.</p> 

                    <p>Collectives of women, chiefly organized under <a href="http://www.colmenacimarrona.org/">La Colmena Cimarrona</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Alianza-Mujeres-Viequenses-100064549365660/">Alianza de Mujeres Viequenses</a>, have steadfastly resisted and vocalized concerns over the Puerto Rican government's allowance of unchecked property acquisition, particularly for short-term rentals. This trend has unfolded as local residents grapple with escalating challenges in accessing affordable housing.</p> 
                    
                    <p>A comprehensive study conducted by Estudios Técnicos highlighted Vieques as the seventh most active region in Puerto Rico's burgeoning short-term rental industry, boasting 690 such properties. Leading this charge is Airbnb, the predominant platform for managing short-term rentals.</p> 
                    
                    <strong>Scraping Airbnb</strong></p> 
                    
                    <p>This article involved the scraping of host information from Airbnb listings. While Airbnb's page declares a total of 537 short-term rental options in Vieques, only 270 are visible across the 15 pages of search results. This stands in stark contrast to the scant two long-term rental alternatives available on Puerto Rico's primary real estate search site, clasificadospr.com.</p> 
                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-pictogram" data-src="visualisation/14697724"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                    <p>A poignant grievance voiced by Viequenses is that while they grapple with modest-paying jobs, inadequate medical services, under-resourced schools, and an ailing maritime transportation system, individuals with more substantial financial means – many of whom neither reside nor contribute significant taxes to Puerto Rico – are acquiring properties meant to serve the local community. These structures are being repurposed for short-term tourist rentals, resulting in community displacement and further exacerbating the cost of living in an already challenging environment.</p> 
                    
                    <p>An analysis of Airbnb listings for Vieques yielded host information from 219 listings. Since some hosts possess multiple listings, duplicates were pruned, resulting in 153 distinct hosts. Out of these, only 119 had updated their profiles with information about their place of residence. Notably, 52 out of the 119 indicated that they lived outside of Vieques or Puerto Rico.</p> 
                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-pictogram" data-src="visualisation/14697655"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>                    <p>According to the sentiment shared by Vieques residents, any business that fails to prioritize the welfare of the local communities where it operates falls short of acceptability. Their ongoing struggle underscores the urgency of securing equitable access to decent housing within their cherished island enclave.</p>

                <strong>Methodology</strong>

<em>I open de website using browser automation with Selenium. Then scraped it to parse the urls to every listing, looped through each one to get the host urls and then, get the information of every host. I saved the information in a dataframe to analyze in Pandas. </em>

<em>For the visualizations, I used Flourish. Here is my GitHub repository.</em>
